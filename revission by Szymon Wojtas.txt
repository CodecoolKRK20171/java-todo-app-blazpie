TodoItem file:

	10: implement Comparable interface: good practice.
	15: Why use to TodoList object here? OOP relationships are getiing complicated by this.
		If you have to use it: think about changing name: myList can be missunderstaing.
	20 - 40: Overloded constructors. It is good practice. But are you sure, you need them all?
	95: method to save: Nice idea.
	
TodoList:
	
	15 - 29: these constructors can be dangerous. Maybe, if construcotur without String in parameter will be used,
		maybe name shuld be assigned by default?
	97. toString method: think about string formatting (String.formatting) in opposition to overloded string adding.
